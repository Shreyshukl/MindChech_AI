    "text2": "The condition typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, though early signs may appear earlier in childhood.",
    "text3": "Despite its relatively low prevalence (about 0.3–0.7%), schizophrenia is one of the top 15 causes of global disability.",
    "text4": "Subtle cognitive and social changes often precede full psychotic symptoms, offering opportunities for early intervention.",
    "text5": "While chronic, many individuals can lead meaningful lives with proper treatment and support."
