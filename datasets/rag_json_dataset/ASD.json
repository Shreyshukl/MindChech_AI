    "section": "Overview",
    "text1": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental condition that impacts how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.",
    "text2": "ASD typically appears in the first two years of life and affects individuals across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.",
    "text3": "It is called a 'spectrum' disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience.",
    "text4": "Some individuals with ASD may have significant challenges and require substantial support, while others may be highly independent.",
    "text5": "Although ASD is a lifelong condition, early diagnosis and intervention can lead to improved outcomes over time."

    "section": "Causes",
    "text1": "ASD arises from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences.",
    "text2": "Multiple genes have been linked to autism, and mutations or disruptions in brain development may contribute.",
    "text3": "Environmental factors—such as parental age, pregnancy complications, or exposure to toxins—may increase risk.",
    "text4": "Research shows shared molecular pathways between ASD and other neurological conditions like ADHD or epilepsy.",
    "text5": "ASD is **not** caused by vaccines; this misconception has been scientifically disproven."

    "text1": "Diagnosis of ASD involves evaluating developmental history, behavior, and social functioning.",
    "text2": "Pediatricians may conduct initial screenings during routine checkups using standardized tools.",
    "text3": "If concerns are noted, a comprehensive evaluation by specialists such as psychologists or developmental pediatricians is recommended.",
    "text4": "Criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are used for formal diagnosis.",
    "text5": "ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 to 24 months, and early identification is key to effective intervention."

    "text2": "Behavioral therapies, especially Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), are widely used and evidence-based.",
    "text3": "Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and social skills training can support communication and independence.",
    "text4": "Some individuals may benefit from medications that address related symptoms like anxiety, irritability, or attention issues.",
    "text5": "Family education and involvement in treatment planning significantly enhance progress and outcomes."

    "text1": "Parents should consult a health professional if they notice delays in speech, social smiling, eye contact, or play behavior.",
    "text2": "Warning signs may include limited verbal communication, lack of response to name, or repetitive movements.",
    "text3": "Early screening tools are available and can be administered by pediatricians during well-child visits.",
    "text4": "The earlier a child is evaluated and receives services, the better the long-term developmental outcomes.",
    "text5": "Support is also available for adolescents and adults diagnosed later in life; seeking help at any age is beneficial."
