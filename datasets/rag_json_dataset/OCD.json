    "text2": "Brain imaging studies suggest functional and structural differences in areas that regulate fear response and decision-making.",
    "text3": "People with family members who have OCD are at increased risk, indicating a hereditary contribution.",
    "text4": "Stressful life events such as illness, relationship problems, or trauma may trigger or exacerbate OCD symptoms in vulnerable individuals.",

    "section": "Treatment Options",
    "text1": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is considered the gold standard treatment for OCD.",
    "text2": "ERP involves gradual exposure to obsessional triggers without engaging in compulsive behaviors, helping reduce fear and urge over time.",
    "text3": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often effective in reducing OCD symptoms, especially at higher doses.",
    "text4": "In treatment-resistant cases, other medications like clomipramine or augmentation strategies may be considered.",
    "text5": "For severe OCD that does not respond to therapy or medication, advanced interventions like deep brain stimulation (DBS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be explored."
