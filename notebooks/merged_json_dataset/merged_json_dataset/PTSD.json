    "text1": "Post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.",
    "text2": "Such events may include combat, assault, natural disasters, or severe accidents.",
    "text3": "PTSD is diagnosed when symptoms persist for more than one month and significantly interfere with daily functioning.",
    "text4": "It affects emotional well-being, leading to heightened alertness, intrusive memories, and impairment in social and occupational areas.",
    "text5": "Although many people experience trauma, only a subset develop PTSD, influenced by individual vulnerability and support systems."

    "text2": "Avoidance symptoms involve steering clear of reminders like people, places, or situations associated with the trauma.",
    "text3": "Mood and thought changes may include persistent negative beliefs, memory gaps, or inability to feel positive emotions.",
    "text4": "Arousal and reactivity symptoms include being easily startled, hypervigilance, irritability, and sleep disturbances.",

    "text2": "Not everyone exposed to trauma develops PTSD; genetic, psychological, and social factors influence risk.",
    "text3": "Factors like prior trauma, lack of support, and personal coping style can increase vulnerability.",
    "text4": "Brain changes in areas that regulate stress and emotion (e.g., amygdala, prefrontal cortex) may contribute.",
    "text5": "Hormonal responses to stress (like cortisol dysregulation) may set the stage for persistent PTSD symptoms."
