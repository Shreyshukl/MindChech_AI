    "section": "Overview",
    "text1": "Obsessive‑Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where individuals experience recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions).",
    "text2": "Obsessions often involve fears of contamination, harming others, or needing symmetry, while compulsions are performed to reduce anxiety tied to those obsessions.",
    "text3": "Symptoms typically begin in late childhood or early adulthood, though they can appear earlier or later in life.",
    "text4": "OCD can significantly disrupt daily functioning, affecting work, school, relationships, and self-esteem.",
    "text5": "Despite its chronic nature, OCD is highly treatable—especially when recognized and managed early."

    "section": "Symptoms",
    "text1": "Obsessions are intrusive ideas or images that cause intense anxiety or distress and are hard to control.",
    "text2": "Common compulsions include repetitive hand-washing, checking locks, arranging items, counting, and repeating words or rituals.",
    "text3": "Compulsions may temporarily reduce anxiety but can become time-consuming, interfering with daily life.",
    "text4": "Some individuals experience 'mental compulsions,' such as silently repeating phrases or praying to neutralize obsessions.",
    "text5": "Both obsessions and compulsions can vary in content and severity, and often co-occur with anxiety or depressive disorders."

    "text2": "Brain imaging studies suggest functional and structural differences in areas that regulate fear response and decision-making.",
    "text3": "People with family members who have OCD are at increased risk, indicating a hereditary contribution.",
    "text4": "Stressful life events such as illness, relationship problems, or trauma may trigger or exacerbate OCD symptoms in vulnerable individuals.",
    "text5": "Learned behavioral patterns and cognitive beliefs—such as overestimating threats—can also reinforce obsession-compulsion cycles."

    "section": "Treatment Options",
    "text1": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is considered the gold standard treatment for OCD.",
    "text2": "ERP involves gradual exposure to obsessional triggers without engaging in compulsive behaviors, helping reduce fear and urge over time.",
    "text3": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often effective in reducing OCD symptoms, especially at higher doses.",
    "text4": "In treatment-resistant cases, other medications like clomipramine or augmentation strategies may be considered.",
    "text5": "For severe OCD that does not respond to therapy or medication, advanced interventions like deep brain stimulation (DBS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be explored."
